# Wrangle-and-analyze-data

This project it done in order to succeed the Udacity Data analyst nanodegree. 
In this project I done all the data wrangling process, which is: gather, assess and clean data.
However, I used the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib. In addition, 
I ask questions and answered them with a given dataset, as well as present the results of the analysis.

# What is WeRateDogs:
“We rate dogs” is a humorous twitter account, the idea behind is to comments
and rates people’s dogs, the most ratings have a denominator of 10 and
numerators greater than 10, and the higher numerators indicate that the dog is
very good looking. However, the popularity of the account gained when some
gay on Twitter name Brant comment his dissatisfaction about the rating system,
and the WeRateDogs account replayed “they're good dogs Brent” purposefully
misspelling Brant name, for some reason this replay has a huge hit and
screenshot of the mention exchange between the Tweeters, received
international media coverage, and memes been created about it. In addition, the
account has gained almost 9 million followers since its debut.


#Datasets used:
Thanks to Udacity I put my hands on three important datasets to analyze the
 account which is:
 twitter archive (from 2015- to 2017): which is a dataset include basic tweet data
 (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) However, the Udacity Instructor has enhanc the
dataset by using the text column to extract rating, dog name, and dog "stage"
(i.e. doggo, floofer, pupper, and puppo). Also, Udacity provided me with the
additional Data via the Twitter API, which is the very important data to analysis
(retweet count and favorite count). And finally, the Image Predictions dataset,
the instructor has ran all the images in the WeRateDogs Twitter archive through
a neural network that can classify breeds of dogs. The results: a table full of
image predictions alongside each tweet ID, image URL.
